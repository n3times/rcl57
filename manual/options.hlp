==Turbo Speed==

Makes RCL-57 approximately 1000 times faster than the original TI-57.

==Alpha Display==

Uses an alphanumeric display to represent instructions in LRN mode: for example @@STO 2@@ instead of @@32 2@@ on an actual TI-57.

==HP LRN Mode==

Makes the TI-57 behave like a classic HP calculator in LRN mode: it displays the last step entered instead of the upcoming one.

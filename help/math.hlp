==Trigonometry==

Make sure to select the appropriate trigonometric units: $$2nd Deg$$, $$2nd Rad$$ or $$2nd Grd$$.

To compute the standard trigonometric functions, press $$2nd sin$$, $$2nd cos$$ or $$2nd tan$$.

Use the $$INV$$ modifier to compute their inverses.

==Other Functions==

$$lnx$$ computes the natural logarithm.
$$INV lnx$$ e^x.
$$2nd log$$ the decimal logarithm.
$$INV 2nd log$$ 10^x.
$$2nd Int$$ the integer part.
$$INV 2nd Int$$ the fractional part.

==Polar/Rectangular Conversions==

''Polar to Rectangular:''
:'''radius''' $$x:t$$ '''angle''' $$2nd P/R$$.
The display will show '''y''' and $$x:t$$ '''x'''.
''Rectangular to Polar:''
:'''x''' $$x:t$$ '''y''' $$INV 2nd P/R$$.
The display will show '''angle''' and $$x:t$$ '''radius'''.

==Degrees Conversions==

''Degrees/minutes/seconds to decimal degrees:''
:$$2nd d.ms$$

''Decimal degrees to degrees/minutes/seconds:''
:$$INV 2nd d.ms$$

==Statistics==

Before using the Statistics functions, press
:$$Inv 2nd C.t$$.
This will reset the registers used by these functions.

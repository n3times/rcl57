RCL-57 comes in 4 different flavors, each one building on the previous one.

''Classic:'' Behaves like an actual TI-57.

''Turbo:'' True to the original while being 1000 times faster. Recommended for most users.

''Alpha'': Uses an alphanumeric display to represent instructions in LRN mode: for example @@STO 2@@ instead of @@32 2@@ on an actual TI-57.

''Rebooted:'' Makes the TI-57 behave like an HP calculator in LRN mode: it displays the last step entered instead of the upcoming one.
